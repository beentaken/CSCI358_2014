**Identity Farming**

- the concept of raising people just to harvest their identity for using for other people
- this is costly and difficult
- however it does raise the idea that you will never need to appear physically infront of anyone anymore
- our socetity is driven by data
- our data can live on without us

##Single Identity

- there is no way for *anonymity*
- it be very easy to *traceable* since there is only one place of origin
- *privacy* goes straight out the window, and hard to maintain
- unable to *deny* since it is tied to the identity
- difficult to *repude* since it will tie to the identity
- there is *accountabilty* 

Examples of this:

- PGP/GPG
- facebook
- twitter
- email

##Anonymity

- *anonymity* is natural advantage
- it be very difficult to *traceable* 
- *privacy* is now part of the system
- able to *deny*
- able to *repude*
- there is no *accountabilty* 

Examples of this:

- reddit
- 4chan
- irc
