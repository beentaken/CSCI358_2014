## a. What is it?

Given a sitation of confessing (defecting) or remaining silent (cooperating) for two individuals might not cooperate given if it best outcome for both of them

## b. Pareto

### What strategy is Pareto efficient in this problem, but less likely to occur in practice?

Cooperating is pareto effiectent, but is unlikely to happen defect COULD lead to a higher payout.

### Why is it less likely to occur in practice?

People generally act selfishly and think of their own reward not the collective group.

#Q4 - False Economy

An action that saves money in the beginning but over an extended period of time results in more money being spent. 

##Vimes 'boots'
> Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

> But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

#Q5 - False Economy in terms of software

The false economy, totally applies to software. 

Using the example of university assignments. University students will have been given a programming task to complete, however the code that is produced is only good for that one case, it will be, generally, quite difficult to expand on it to make a more complete solution if more tasks are needed. 

However when deleveloping code that is not used for a one off solution, it is much more imporant to consider about planning since the code will be needed for many interations and changes not just a short term solution.
