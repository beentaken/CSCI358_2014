#Q1. Make some notes on the following two articles. Should the developers of software that breaks the law be held liable/responsible?

No, but they are not free of all crimes either. 

This automated bot, goes and buys an random item from the "darknet". And just by happen-stance once day illcient substances was purchased. 

I dont believe the developers that are to blame, but they should take some responsibility since this bot was conditioned for, it was bound to stumble upon something that was illegal. So they should pay a fine or something of the like. 

However, if drugs were legal then there are no problems. So i feel that the place that society is placed in is something that matters in context of the application as well. So if we lived in a society in which drugs are legal, and cola is not is that the same? Maybe.


#Q2. Use the key calculator at http://www.keylength.com/en/compare/ to determine how the symmetric key size should vary as a function of the length of time data needs to be protected to. Choose three of the methods given there to graph. Choose appropriate time intervals over a period of about 100 years.

##Buying Exploits on the Grey Market

Reference: https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2012/0415.html#8

###(a) Why did you choose this particular topic?

I think that this is still a concern for infosec for years to come. People finding bugs but not reporting it (you could even include as grey/black hat or a hacker or a spy). 

###(b) A summary of what the entry is about.

Companies buying zero-day exploits for popular applications or platforms. The article refers to buying the exploits for bug bounty programs or for espionage or cyber weapons. 

###(c) An identification of the security problem of relevance.

Software bugs and exploits: 

As long as software is being developed there will always be various forms of bugs and vulnerabilities, it being originated from technical issues, like shell code being executed on your servers or threatening someone to give up admin passwords or *insert generic bad thing here* will happen to them. 

###(d) If possible, an indication of how the entry relates to the subject.

This relates to a couple of subtopics in this subject namely

- The problems with people
- Managing the development of secure systems
- policies and principles

Most of it comes down to:

- making sure that the system/software that you have developed is unable to be hacked into
	- naturally this is an ongoing task
	- you would need to keep track of what tools you used and ensure that any security patches are applied
	- you would need some defense measures (logging, alerts, etc) in the application
	- bugs should be dealt with properly
- making sure that people understand what they are doing and that they follow polices and procedures 
- making sure that your policies and procedures are sound

###(e) If possible, an indication as to whether the problem discussed is still a problem.

Yes, this would be a fundamental infosec problem even if this application is used for spying (which i feel is one of the more likely application). 

Since this scenario is basically (i feel)  a black hat (team), becomes a vendor for bugs and vulnerabilities, legitimate companies buy it (ie, not other blackhat or hackers) this company can take one of two forms
- is the company that the exploit works for
	- then they are buying information on the exploit on the system
- is a completing company
	- they can use it to spy on competitors
	- they can use it to gain infomation
	- they can use it for bribery
	- they can use it for boosting their own product.

###(f) If possible, a relevant challenge question for the class.

Is it reasonable to make a team that just is a group of people working at various companies to share exploits and collectively profit?
(like a mafia of hackers)
