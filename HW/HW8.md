#Q1. Make some notes on the following two articles. Should the developers of software that breaks the law be held liable/responsible?

No, but they are not free of all crimes either. 

This automated bot, goes and buys an random item from the "darknet". And just by happen-stance once day illcient substances was purchased. 

I dont believe the developers that are to blame, but they should take some responsibility since this bot was conditioned for, it was bound to stumble upon something that was illegal. So they should pay a fine or something of the like. 

However, if drugs were legal then there are no problems. So i feel that the place that society is placed in is something that matters in context of the application as well. So if we lived in a society in which drugs are legal, and cola is not is that the same? Maybe.


#Q2. Use the key calculator at http://www.keylength.com/en/compare/ to determine how the symmetric key size should vary as a function of the length of time data needs to be protected to. Choose three of the methods given there to graph. Choose appropriate time intervals over a period of about 100 years.
