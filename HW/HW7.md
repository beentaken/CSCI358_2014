#1. These questions mostly relate to the physical security mantra: ”Deter - detect - alarm - delay - respond.”

##a. Consider the following classes of device and describe where the protection they provide acts
with respect to the mantra.

###i. Walls
- deter
	- no one wants to walk through walls
- delay
	- its might be hard getting to the place if there is a wall in the way

###ii. Doors
- deter
	- you might need a key to get in
- delay
	- its might be hard getting to the place if there is a door in the way
- detect
	- if you have sensors hooked up
- alarm
	- when triggered it can alarm

###iii. Smoke Detectors
- detect
	- checks for smoke
- alarm
	- when triggered it can alarm	

###iv. Security Guards
- deter
	- you dont want to mess with scary people
- delay
	- its might be hard getting to the place if there is a scary people in the way
- detect
	- if they see something
- alarm
	- they can be make a noise
- respond
	- big people look scary and might be able to solve a issue

##b. Consider an example of a physical security mechanism that doesn’t fall into one of the above classes. See how it serves with respect to the mantra.

ID Card/ Token; It used for access but not preventation

##c. Are there equivalents to all or some of the five components in the context of information security? What, if any, would they be and why?

#2. Read the Scientific America article that can be found in `HW7-People-Tricked.pdf`. Consider the effect this type of effect, `choice blindness`, might have in making choices on the internet. Try and think of a way this could be exploited in an online attack.

#3. What is risk homeostasis and how does it relate to this subject? Make up an example in the context of information security.

#4. Look at `HW7-Information Security Interview Questions.pdf`.

##a. How many of those could you correctly/usefully answer?

##b. Are there any significant gaps in your knowlege?

##c. Have a look at `HW7-The Ramp.pdf` too
