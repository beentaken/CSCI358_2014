##Significant systems and reasoning && ramfications

Honestly, i believe all are significant. With lesser significance on higher levels.

My reasoning is that the more basic systems (like frameworks, and clockworks which are equal to frameworks and tools for frameworks and a IPC for clockworks). Should be well understood, this will reduce certanity, however as we move up the levels, our understanding and uncertanity raise. As we approach Human, Social Organisations, and Transcendental stage there is high amounts of risk. These are represented as human, businesses or groups, and their governing reasoning. This is difficult to understand, and in turn predict for security uses.

A fail stop processor is a procesor that is still active but doesnt take input or give any output except for the error message if that exists.

If a failstop processor triggers, you will need some redundacy in the system since you dont want zero processor running in the system.
