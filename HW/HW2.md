**Identity Farming**

- the concept of raising people just to harvest their identity for using for other people
- this is costly and difficult
- however it does raise the idea that you will never need to appear physically infront of anyone anymore
- our socetity is driven by data
- our data can live on without us

##Single Identity

- there is no way for *anonymity*
- it be very easy to *traceable* since there is only one place of origin
- *privacy* goes straight out the window, and hard to maintain
- unable to *deny* since it is tied to the identity
- difficult to *repude* since it will tie to the identity
- there is *accountabilty* 

Examples of this:

- PGP/GPG
  - everyone on the keyserver knows who you are
  - very transparent, not very anonymous
- facebook
  - little anonymity and very opaque in terms of what data they gather on you
- twitter
  - little anonymity and very opaque in terms of what data they gather on you
- email
  - some anomymity and there is a bit of metadata that can be gathered

##Anonymity

- *anonymity* is natural advantage
- it be very difficult to *traceable* 
- *privacy* is now part of the system
- able to *deny*
- able to *repude*
- there is no *accountabilty* 

Examples of this:

- reddit
  - lots of anonmity since you barely need any information about yourself (only username and password)
  - they can still gather metadata
- irc
  - aside from ip address (which is easily spoofed) there heaps of anonmity
  - transparent

a. symmetric or public

if you have public key ahead of time of the other party then its fineotherwise symetric is good also

b. symmetric

public key will make it too big.

c. public

you login with your privkey

d. hybrid or public

- public for short messages since you can have your pub key on your keychain
- hybrid for longer messages since pubkey will be too large

4.

a. Telephone banking

- know
  - password

easy to use

- have
  - once time passwords
  - apps

easy to use

can lose it

b. Attending a lecture

- know
- have
- are

Depending on the cost and application all of these are appropriate. However something you have would be the quick and easy to deploy.

c. Registering to get a passport

- are

You need to strongly identify yourself for this strong form of identity. 

d. Entering a secure research lab

- are
- have

a combination of something you have (keypass, sec card) and something you are (photo id or fingerprint)

e. Tour of a museam

- have

using just a keypass should be succifent


f. ringing sysadmin

- have
- are

since it will be hard to recongise your voice as a sysadmin, a one time password token would be ideal.

Also if you want to get fancy you can verify the persons voice as well.

1. hypothesis that organisms (or businesses in info sec case) must constantly adapt and evolve not just to satisfy its own needs but also survive with other organisms.

1. it originated from the book :Through the Looking Glass" from Lewis carroll. From the quote from the Red Queen character "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."

1. companies/ organisations will need to adapt and evolve their own offense and defense not to make their own security secure, but rather to prevent other entities being too powerful. 

1. As you put in things to prevent attacks, the attacks will change as well so your preventation methods will change, which means the attacks will change. This causes an ever existing feedback loop of defense and offence.
