#People and their Money

#What is economics
- using production capacity as efficiently as possible to satisfy the demand for goods and services
- effciency cost of something/time&money
#Game Theory
- Game theory is a branch of mathematics used to explore outcomes of strategies adopted by multiple parties in a multiplayer scenario
- players try to determine best solution given the possibilities
	- best outcome is that giving the highest payout
	- dominant strategy is the best independent of what our opponent does
- assume rational opponents
- repeated games result in different outcomes
- market power is a measure of how much an entity is able to control the price and 
#Background Economics
- classical economics is people driven, in the sense we are trying to meet the demands of the people
	- modelling the relationships between supply, demands, labour and capitial can lead to efficient and stable solutions
	- the idea is in practice competition in the market will drive the market to a stable efficent solution
##Monopolies
- single supplier of gns
	- set the price to whatever they want
- consumers will buy at they price they can
- discriminating monopolist is charging everybody exactly what they are prepared to pay
- market power is a measure how much an entity is able to control the price and other conditions of sale without suffering an impact from competion
##Public Goods
- non-rivalrous such that being used by one person doesnt exclude others
- non-excludable such that its impractical to exclude people from using
- market fails to produce optimal solutions
#Information Economics
- marginal cost of production
	- the collective cost of the parts used to make that part
- lock in
	- need to buy stuff related to system
- asymmetric information
	- markets can also fail when information held by some participants is more than that of the others
- adverse selection
	- people use secrets for their advantage
- moral hazard
	- hidden actions that take place after an agreement to advantage one party over another
#Economics of Security
- inefficient mechanisms
	- minimum effort (weakest link)
	- best effort
- sum of efforts

##Programs

- program correctness is a function of minimum effort
- testing for vulns in software depends on the sum of all the participants 
- best effort in a critical role makes a large difference too
- having a balance is important
