#Managing the Development of secure systems

##Anderson Framework

- policy: what you supposed to achieve
- mechanism: the tools for policy
- assurance: reliablity
- incentives: to help or hinder

##Modelling Systems

###The fried Egg model

####Formal
- formal polices and rules
- communication between parts is important

####Technical

- automation of parts of the formal system
- held firmly by formal system

####Informal

- flexible interactions between people to ensure that formal system actually work

###Parts

- we can identify assets with respect to different parts
- we can identify vulns and threats with each of those assets at each level
- we can apply controls at each of the levels to protect our assets
- we need to be looking at how controls or elements in those systems interact with elements in other systems

###Management

- people are important
- training, incentives in accordance with our framework are aspect we must consider

###Not realizing that information security

1. is a corporate governance responsibility
1. is a business issue and not a technical issue
1. governance is a multidimensional discipline
1. must be based on identified risks
1. (or using) the important role of international best practices for information security management
1. that a corporate info.Sec. policy is essential
1. that info.Sec. compliance enforcement and monitoring is essential
1. that a proper info.Sec. governance structure is essential
1. the core importance of info.Sec. awareness among users
1. Not empowering info.Sys. security managers with the infrastructure, tools and supporting mechanisms to properly perform their responsibilities

##Assets of the System

###Asset Identification

- Anything of value is an asset.
- Anything, the loss of which, would devalue the system, or what the system can provide, is clearly an asset.

###Responsibility

- how to assets interact
- who is responsible
- how do people interact

###Asset Vulnerabilties

##Threat Modelling

###complacency cycle

1. problem
1. solution
1. solution fails
1. problem

###risk thermostat

- People are comfortable with a certain level of perceived risk 

###Quality and insurance
