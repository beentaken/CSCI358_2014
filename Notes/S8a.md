#Assurance and Evaluation 

##What do we mean by Assurance?

- will it work
	- and do we have the confidence that it will work
- reducing the uncertainty in the system
- for yourself
## What do we mean by Evaluation?

- convincing others it will work
- for others
## Common Criteria

-  set of security requirements that are to be tested for, and considers these in the part of the system to be evaluated, the so-called target of evaluation

###Requirements

- functional
- assurance

###Assurance Requirements

- requirements that are grouped into classes 
	- which contain families
	- which contain components
	- which contain elements
	
### Profiles and targets

- protection profiles
	- implementation independent set of security requirements and objectives
- security targets
	- functional and assurance measures mapped to the objects and requirements within a TOE
## Assurance

- functionality
- strength of mechanisms
- implementation
- Usability

### Project assurance

- regression testing
- security testing
- show that each control objective is assured by one protection mechanism
- checking if working
	- fault injection
	- fuzzing
	- bug discovery
	- rate of know bug discovery
	- patching rates
	
### Process assurance

- who
- how
- what

- ISO9001
