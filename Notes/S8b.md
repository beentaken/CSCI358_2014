#Policies and principles

## Three viewpoints

- designer
- assessor
- user

## Principles for the fried egg model
### Technical

- The development of any technical system must be dynamic and dependent on the environment of application
- CIA are critical, but we need to understand how to achieve them in accordance with the environment

### Formal

- Establish the boundary between what can be formally controlled and what needs to be norm based
- Rules for managing information security have little relevance unless they are contextualized

### Informal
-  Education, training and awareness are important but should not be seen as enough, rather as part of the critical focus on developing a sustainable security culture which is vital for a secure environment
-  Responsibility, Integrity, Trust and Ethicality are the cornerstones for maintaining a secure environment

## Keep It Simple Stupid!
