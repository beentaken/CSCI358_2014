#Q4.

Yes.

since there is a appearent weakspot in your systems you will know where the **likely** attacks will take place this will help with your defence against the attacks since you can focus resources accordingly. Furturmore you can use the weakspot as a honeypot or have the weakspot as a isolated environment.

In terms of a base rate fallacy for false positive and false negatives it would be a case of

You have a system and it has a 90% chance of identifying correctly positive and negatives. 

However when it when incorrectly identifies it has a 99% chance of being the other case (*my phrasing is probs bad here*).

Even thought it is unlikely of being incorrectly identified (10%) since people thing it it extremely likely to be the other case. However people will focus on the 99% since they are people even though it is unlikely to fall in that scenario.

>equal error rate or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate.
