Title: Finding People's Locations Based on Their Activities in Cyberspace

##Reason for choosing this topic

I think as information security people we tend to be obsessed over the actual cryptographic methods but sometimes we tend to overlook the human factors and factors that are external to our systems. One of these are mobiles phones and the internet. And this article "Finding People's Locations Based on Their Activities in Cyberspace" is interesting as we can obfuscate and hide and encrypt our messages but we cant hide ourself.

##Summary of what this entry is about

This article is dealing with how a government security firms track people in the world via a various means. Namely using  
- triangulation using GSM networks complemented from the use of drones
- using wifi information 
- using applications/ webapps since they leak geo-locations 

##Security problem of reference

- communicating securely over each of OSI layers
- how modern technology (not that modern in terms of phone/ gsm, but modern for social networks or wifi networks)
- full end to end encryption

##How it relates to the subject

- 10: Physical Security
- 11: Development of Secure Systems

##Challenge Question

- How would you choose to balance of anonymity of people and traceability?
